how does the internet work

The internet is a global network of computers. Each computer has an unique ip code/address. These computers 
talk/intract to eachother using TCP/IP protocols.A web browser is an application used to request websites and webpages. 
Websites and webpages are files stopred in computers that run a software called the web server. HTTP is an application 
level protocol. HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol, which handles the traffic between web browsers and web servers.

Websites need to be hosted, can then only will they be accessable to the public. They also need a domain name, which is 
usually a simple to understand readable name used to identyify the website. domain name are required to replace long 
chunks of alphanumerals.

When ever a user requests a wesite using its domain name from the browser, the broser basically requests the ip address 
of the website from the DNS server using the domain name. It then uses this ip address to request data from the servers. 
When data is received, it is rendered by the browser and displayed to the user.

Here the DNS is Domain Name Service, the browser is the client and the data requested from the servers are basically html,
css and javascript files.

This has been a very simple and brief explanation.
